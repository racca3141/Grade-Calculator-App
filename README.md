# Grade-Calculator-App

Write two (2) functions and use them in the main.  Be sure to separate function prototypes from their implementations.
1. Write a function that calculates and returns the average of 4 test scores with the following function prototype (no couts):
double testAverage(int t1, int t2, int t3, int t4)
2. Next write a function that takes in the average and returns the letter grade based on a straight scale (no couts). Use this prototype:
char letterGrade(double avg);
Then write a main C++ program that prompts the user for 4 exams and uses the functions to compute the average and show the grade based on a straight scale.  Format the output and implement the run again routine.
Exam #1: 75
Exam #2: 79
Exam #3: 85
Exam #4: 91
Your average is 82.5 = B
Would you like to run again? (y or n): _
